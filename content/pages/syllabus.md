## Class Requirements

There will be homework once every few weeks. There will be no final, but there will be an end of semester paper on a topic of your choice. Grading will be from the homework (which will be largely the development of a GPS data analysis program) and the end of semester paper. The paper will be a review of an area related to the applications of GPS and will developed during the semester (i.e., the paper will be revised for content several times during semester).

It will be acceptable in this course to work together on homework with the aim of better understanding the material and to refer to other books and published material provided that these additional materials are cited appropriately in the homework. Each student should complete the homework separately. It is not acceptable to simply copy the homework of another student.
